                    <h3>NEW YORK</h3>
                    <p>
                        New York, often called New York City (NYC), 
                        is the most populous city in the United States.
                         It is at the southern end of the U.S. state of New York. 
                         Over 8 million people currently live in the city,
                          and over 22 million people live in the bigger New York metropolitan area.

                    <h3>SWIZERLAND</h3>
                    <p>
                        Switzerland, federated country of central Europe. 
                        Switzerland's administrative capital is Bern, 
                        while Lausanne serves as its judicial centre.
                         Switzerland's small size—its total area is about half that of Scotland—and 
                         its modest population give little indication of its international significance.
